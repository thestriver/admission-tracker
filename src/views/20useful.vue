        <h2 class="py-10 text-4xl text-green-600 font-semi-bold ">The University's Reputation and Ranking</h2>
        <p><br />
This naturally comes in handy, because there's always this thing about prestige and value. Education is all about the exchange of value. The University you're seeking to enrol in should afford you a certain level of value in whatever area you deem necessary. Some universities are unique in their teaching methods, others are unparalleled in the level of practice and exposure offered, others provide you with connections to big corporations for easy job location after studies.

Getting to grad school is not exactly a walk in the park, there are different routes through which admission can be sourced. It can either be through direct application to the school or through a third-party where you are awarded a scholarship by international bodies such as Chevening, Erasmus, Commonwealth Shared etc. You can also get in through an invitation by a college professor to pursue a particular research interest. All these routes will involve sending cold emails, personal statements, statement of purpose, research proposals and study plans. Sending these documents has been considered one of the most rigorous parts of the grad school admission process.
</p>

<p class="py-5">

    With these resources, you are assured of a seamless admission process. There are also a handful of other things you need to put in places such as documentation of your certificates, high school or university results. The best place to go to find out about all the legal procedures necessary to become a student is the consulate or embassy of your destination country. Many countries and large training centres such as universities have an Information Agency or Office for Foreign or International Students, where you can also find a lot of information about the procedures to be carried out, legal aspects of the country, the culture of the country, aspects of student life, useful resources, etc
