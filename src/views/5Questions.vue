         You, like many others, are however stuck on the right steps to take
         .<br />
         Applying for a graduate school without any form of experience or guidance can be daunting and frustrating. 
         At The Guide, we know exactly how stressful this process can be but after helping hundreds of aspiring seekers like you get their dream programs, 
         we&rsquo;ve got some really helpful tips for you.</p>
        <p><br />By correctly answering the questions below, we believe you&rsquo;re just one step away from securing admission to the great 
        program you truly want and deserve.<br /></p>
        
        <h2 class="py-10 text-4xl font-semi-bold ">1. Are You Really Ready For Graduate School?</h2>
        
        <p>
        Before applying to a school, I presume you already 
        have a course and degree you would like to enrol for, be it MBA, MA, MS or PhD. If not, you're still on track. You need to ask yourself if you 
        really need to further your study. However, this is dependent on your long term career goal.<br />For example, depending on the program, you 
        necessarily don&rsquo;t need to have a Masters degree if your goal is to be a well-known academic or researcher. You can apply directly with your Bachelor degree provided you&rsquo;ve got great grades. For a professional career, considering a Masters is the better option.</p>
        
        <h2 class="py-10 text-4xl font-semi-bold ">2. Is Funding Available?</h2> 
        
        <p>The most important factor after your personal dedication and achievements is funds, then, funds, then, funds.
         In short, your dream depends on this. If you're rich enough to pay your tuition and additional fees, Good luck! Else, you have to take your 
         time and think about it. The average student loan debt in the US and U.K is about $32,000. You should have an idea of how long it will take to clear such debt. Besides, immigration officials like to see that you&rsquo;re funded and you won&rsquo;t be a liability during your program. <br />Luckily, you don't have to opt for a loan. A lot of graduate programs offer partial or full funding to their admission seekers. Work towards securing a scholarship or graduate assistantship that can offer a tuition waiver, some with additional stipends that cover your living expenses. Once you've decided on how to fund your studies, you can now think about choosing a school.</p>

        <h2 class="py-10 text-4xl font-semi-bold ">4. Have You Checked The Requirements Of The Program? </h2>
        
        <p> Check the requirements of the program and details of the school. Each program has its own requirement. Basically, you are to check if your CGPA is up to the required one.
